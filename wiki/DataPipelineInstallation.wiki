Installation instructions for DataPipeline.

==Windows==

Just download the msi installer package from the downloads section. This will place shortcuts on your desktop.

The easiest way is to use the package manager on your distribution to install python and setuptools. You can then simply type the following at the command line:

easy_install PEATDB DataPipeline

This should also install the other required software. If you have problems installing ZODB3, use the package manager to install python-dev (or python-devel) and gcc.

You can then run the program by typing the command pipelineapp.

==Mac==

There is an installer available in downloads also.
