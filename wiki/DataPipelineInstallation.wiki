Just download the MSI installer from the downloads section. This will place shortcuts on your desktop.

The easiest way is to use the package manager on your distribution to install python and setuptools. You can then simply type the following at the command line:

easy_install PEATDB DataPipeline

Or install the python source package from the downloads section. Unzip the file and type:
