*Ekin *is an application for storage, plotting and non-linear fitting of 2 dimensional x-y data. Ekin can be run as a stand-alone program or as a module from within PEATDB or DataPipeline. Ekin lets you import or manually enter experimental data and fit them to standard equations used in biochemistry/biophysics.

= Overview =

Experimental data can be entered directly into Ekin by typing data in the upper left-hand table, and can also be imported in various formats in the Data pulldown menu.

The lower left side of the Ekin window holds information on the current Ekin data model and the associated [[Fit parameters]], which can be changed by clicking the model selector button. The fit models that are available are controlled by the Ekin mode.

See DataPipelineModelFitting and ModelDesign for more information on these features.

= Availability =

Ekin is distributed as part of the PEATDB and DataPipeline applications. If you have installed either of these in windows a shortcut to Ekin will be placed in the start menu. If you have used easy_install to install them, the command 'ekin' will open the program from the command line.
