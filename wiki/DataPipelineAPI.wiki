==Introduction==

DataPipeline is written in python and can be extended by writing a custom Importer class. Users who are interested in adding their own importers may find the information here useful.

==Base classes==

These are held in the Base.py and consist of:
Pipeline: Handles all file reading/writing, queuing, fitting and joining of data, managing configuration files and is the core of the the module.
BaseImporter: This class does the actual import from the file, given a configuration. It has basic methods for
getting rows, headers etc. In practice this is always subclassed and the doImport method overridden to achieve the desired functionality. There are currently 8 Importer classes built in to DataPipeline that handle the most common text formats.
These are:

 DatabyColImporter
 DatabyRowImporter
 PairedDatabyColImporter
 PairedDatabyRowImporter
 GroupedDatabyColImporter
 GroupedDatabyRowImporter
