==pKaTool Windows problems==

The pKaTool installer package seems to have problems on Windows 7. If this is the case then try the following approach:

 # Download pKaTool.zip above
 # Unpack the zip file into C:\Python2.6\Lib\site-packages (this path might be slightly different on your computer)
 # Add a shortcut to C:\Python2.6\Lib\site-packages\pKaTool\pKarun_main.py to your Desktop
 # double-click the shortcut and you should be good to go.
